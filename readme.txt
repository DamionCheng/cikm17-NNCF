==========Run the model: python main.py===========

Take Rossmann for example

Parameters:

N_test_negative(99): the number of negative samples in the testing ranking list

max_neighbors(50): the maximum neighbors in our algorithm

N_train_negative(4): the number of negative samples in training

embedding_dim(32): the output dimension of MLP

nb_layer(3): the number of layers in MLP

nb_epoch(100): training epoch

LR(0.001): learning rate

================================File Description===========================

01: Process input data: data.csv (userid,itemid)

02: Split train & test set and construct graph

03,04: Construct direct neighbors of model (NNCF_direct)

03-1,04-1: Construct community neighbors of model (NNCF_community)

03-2: Construct knn neighbors of model (NNCF_knn)

05: Training model

06: Evaluation of model

Python version: 2.7.3, Keras versionï¼š2.1.5, Tensorflow: 1.6.0. 


Note: the python files are independent to make our project more flexible and extensible. You can tuning parameters and run the corresponding python file that you need.
